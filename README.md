## How to run

On your terminal go to the project root folder and simply enter:

```
bin/missing_number
```

You will be asked to enter a sequence of integers separated by a comma "," 

```
Please enter the sequence (e.g., 1,3,4,...):
```

You will then be asked what is the nth number you are looking for:

And that's it! You should now see on your terminal the value of the nth missing number on the sequence.
